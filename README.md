# USYD Coursework

The following repository holds any projects or assignments which I have deemed worthy of sharing from my coursework at USYD.

Degree: Bachelor of Software Engineering/Bachelor of Science (Mathematical Sciences) (Data Science)

## Progression
I am leaving my degree progression here as to hopefully help someone out who's anxious about changing engineering streams in the middle of their degree. I was part of the aeronautical stream in first year and then changed to software at the beginning of second year. I also swapped my BSc major from physics to data science in the middle of my first year. 

A subject in **bold** means I have some coursework uploaded to this repository from that unit.
