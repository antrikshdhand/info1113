# USYD Coursework

The following repository holds any projects or assignments which I have deemed worthy of sharing from my coursework at USYD. By no means is my work perfect but if this helps any students out then I'm happy to share.

Degree: Bachelor of Software Engineering/Bachelor of Science (Mathematical Sciences) (Data Science)

## Progression
I am leaving my degree progression here as to hopefully help a future student out. Please note that I originally started out doing a Bachelor of Aeronautical Engineering and Bachelor of Science (Physics) before changing to my current degree.

A subject in **bold** means I have some coursework uploaded to this repository from that unit.
