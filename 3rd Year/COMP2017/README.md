# COMP2017: Systems Programming

*Taken in 2023 Semester 1*

Ah, COMP2017 â€“ the most infamous, the most notoriously difficult computer science unit at USYD. 

I'm pleased to say that I really, really enjoyed this unit. I think a reason for that is the fact that they have really simplified this unit compared to previous years. This semester there was no final exam; only 4 internal assessments:

- A1: Basic C programming assignment (10%)
- A2: Creating a RISC-V 32I emulator (5% + 30% viva)
- A3: Creating an exchange using pipes and processes (5% + 10% + 30% viva)
- Problem13: A security related assignment (10%)

Any student who took this unit in the 2010's is probably looking at that in awe as they compare it to their 10+ assessments across the semester, including a heftily-weighted final exam. This is perhaps the first iteration of this unit where a HD was "easy" to obtain, given you put in enough time in the unit.

Unfortunately, I did not do as well in this unit as I wished, as I was unable to complete the A3 viva requirements in time. The combination of taking this unit alongside COMP2123 and STAT2011 really got to me, and I did not correctly prioritise this unit over the others when it mattered most.

Regardless, I have uploaded my A1 (10/10) and A2 (30.25/35) here.

Good luck to any future students doing COMP2017!
