# `vm_RISKXVII`

The most fun I've ever had doing an assignment in computer science at USYD was this assignment.

Assignment 2 had us create our own virtual machine for a simplified RISC-V 32I architecture. This not only made me thank the heavens I paid attention in ELEC1601, but I learnt *so* much about how a computer actually works. We actually built a fetch-decode-execute program in C â€“ how cool is that?

Here are 3 resources I *highly recommend* you use to get your head around A2. Don't just dive right into the assignment: do some research first and you'll save yourself a bunch of headache:

- John Winan's Lectures on RISC-V 32I: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKB5I12LctU
- John Winan's Reference book on RISC-V 32I: https://github.com/johnwinans/rvalp 
- Justin Meiner's "Write your Own Virtual Machine": https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/ 

You may also want to look up bit-masking and shifting and virtual memory management before you start.
