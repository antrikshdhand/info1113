# COMP2123: Data Structures and Algorithms

*Taken in 2023 Semester 1*

What a unit! 

COMP2123 is definitely the hardest unit I've taken at USYD so far in terms of pure difficulty and complexity. The amount of time and effort it takes to keep up to date with the content and engage with assignments and tutorials is truly beyond any other unit I've taken. In saying that, it is also very intellectually rewarding. The feeling of "getting" the optimal solution to a tutorial or exam question is very sweet.

In this repo I have provided my solutions to the three written assignments we had over the course of the semester, as well as the official solutions:

- Assignment 1 (98/100)
- Assignment 3 (97/100)
- Assignment 4 (86/100)
