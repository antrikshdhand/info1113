# USYD 3rd Year

The following directory contains files related to the following units I completed in my third year:

<pre>
3rd Year
└── Intensive January
    └── <b>MATH1115: Interrogating Data</b> 
└── Semester 1
    ├── <b>COMP2017: Systems Programming</b>
    └── <b>COMP2123: Data Structures and Algorithms<b>
</pre>

Note that I went on a semester-long exchange in Semester 2 to the National University of Singapore, and hence there are no files for any of those units (CS3109, SOFT2201, ST3131, and COMP3027).
