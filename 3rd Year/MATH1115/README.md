# MATH1115: Interrogating Data

*Taken in 2023 Intensive January*

The combination of MATH1005 and MATH1115 is equivalent to DATA1001. Hence, in comparison to MATH1005, this unit focuses on the more "data science"-focused topics, especially how to use the `tidyverse` packages in R to more effectively manipulate data.

The unit consisted of two projects each worth 10%, one which was to be done in a group and one individual project.

### Project 1

We were given a dataset (in this case data relating to the crowd-sourced loan organisation Kiva) and were asked to investigate a few research questions of our choosing. We were to produce a written report in R markdown along with a presentation that summarised our main findings.

You can find our code here: https://github.com/antrikshdhand/math1115-project-1 

### Project 2:

Project 2 was largely similar to Project 1 except that we were given the choice out of two datasets, and we were expected to pose as a stakeholder of our choosing when proposing research questions.
