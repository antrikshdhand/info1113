# AERO1560

## Assignment 1
**Aircraft/Spacecraft Familiarity Exercise**

Part 1: The task was to pick an uncommon operational aircraft and produce a 7 page report detailing its technical, operational and safety aspects. This was to be accompanied by a 5 minute pre-recorded presentation (which I have not attached).

Part 2: Locate the max range, MTOW and max payload of all known variants of the Boeing 707, 717, 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, and 787; and Airbus A300, A310, A318, A319, A320, A321, A330, A340, A350, and the A380. A predictive analysis was to be conducted based on a hypothetical "new airliner" to be commissioned.
