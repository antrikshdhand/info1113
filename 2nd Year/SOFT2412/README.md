# SOFT2412: Agile Software Development Practices

This unit is heavily group-work focused, and is split into 2 main projects, one worth 15% and the second worth 25%. The first project is more focused on learning how to use Git, Gradle, Jenkins etc. while the second is focused on how to implement the Scrum methodology in your team projects.
