# ISYS2120: Data and Information Management

*Taken in 2022 Semester 2*

Easily one of my favourite units I've taken at USYD. The content is extremely interesting and the assessments are fun and do-able. Professor Fekete is a great lecturer (though his assignment notifications are a bit unwieldy at times) and is knowledgable about the subject matter, given it is the basis of his research area.

The internal assessments were all group-work based. The major assignment was Assignment 3 (15%) in which you had to use Python's Flask library to create a CRUD application based on given data. This was accompanied by an extensive report. Assignment 4 was centered around indexing.

Both the assignments uploaded here were group assignments and therefore contain more than just my work. Both the assignments scored full marks.
