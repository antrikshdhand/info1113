# MATH1023

*Taken in 2021 Semester 2*

A beautifully taught unit with equally beautiful Beamer slide decks (props to Dr Haotian Wu for those).

The first assignment in this directory, regarding basic differential equations, was worth 4%. The second, regarding partial derivatives and systems of DE's, was worth 8%. Both assignments received full marks.
