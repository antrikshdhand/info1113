# MATH1002

This unit was honestly one of my favourite first year units. The content was interesting, the tutorial sheets were (surprisingly) helpful with a good mix of foundational and more complex questions, and the lecturer (Emily Brown at the time) was fantastic.

This directory contains the two assignments from this unit, both worth 5% each. Assignment 1 focuses on vectors while Assignment 2 focuses on matrices. 

Note that this was just the very beginning of my journey with LaTeX and so the typesetting may not be perfect. Regardless, I do remember being extremely proud of Assignment 2 when I had finished with it.
