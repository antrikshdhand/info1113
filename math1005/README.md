# MATH1005

The project I have uploaded here is the individual project we had to complete towards the end of semester.

Students were required to select from one of four data stories. I chose the data story regarding the Sydney Cross City Tunnel, and pitched it as Sydney's most blundered infrastructure project. I utilised numerical and graphical summaries to prove this, as well as plenty of background research and citations to back up my claims. 

I scored 19/20 for this project.

_Data story 4: Cars and trucks passing through the Cross City Tunnel. This dataset provide logs of the number of cars and trucks passing through the Cross City Tunnel in 15 minute intervals for the whole month of March: one for 2019 and one for 2020. Source: NSW Toll Road Data (RSM)._
